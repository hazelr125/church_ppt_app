1,"1. Oh, wor-ship the King,\nAll glo-rious a-bove!\nOh, grate-ful-ly sing\nHis pow'r and His love;\nOur Shield and De-fend-er,\nThe An-cient of Days,\nPa-vil-ioned in splen-dor\nAnd gird-ed with praise!\n\n2. Oh, tell of His might,\nOh, sing of His grace,\nWhose robe is the light,\nWhose can-o-py space!\nHis char-iots of wrath,\nThe deep thun-der-clouds form,\nAnd dark is His path\nOn the wings of the storm.\n\n3. This earth, with its store\nOf won-ders un-told,\nAl-might-y, Thy pow'r\nHath found-ed of old,\nHath 'stab-lished it fast\nBy a change-less de-cree;\nAnd round it hath cast,\nLike a man-tie, the sea.\n\n4. Thy boun-ti-ful care,\nWhat tongues can re-cite?\nIt breathes in the air,\nIt shines in the light,\nIt streams from the hills,\nIt de-scends to the plain,\nAnd sweet-ly dis-tils in\nThe dew and the rain.\n",,,
2,"1. Be-fore Je-ho-vah's awful throne,\nYe na-tions, bow with sa-cred joy,\nKnow that the Lord is God a-lone,\nHe can cre-ate, and He de-stroy.\n\n2. His sov-reign pow'r, with-out our aid,\nMade us of clay and formed us men;\nAnd when like wan-d'ring sheep we strayed,\nHe brought us to His fold a-gain.\n\n3. We are His peo-ple, we His care,\nOur souls and all our mor-tal frame.\nWhat last-ing hon-ors shall we rear,\nAl-might-y Mak-er, to Thy name?\n\n4. We'll crowd Thy gates with thankful songs,\nHigh as the heav'ns our voices raise;\nAnd earth, with her ten thousand tongues,\nShall fill Thy courts with sounding praise.\n\n5. Wide as the world is Thy command,\nVast as eternity Thy love;\nFirm as a rock Thy truth must stand,\nWhen rolling years shall cease to move.\n",,,
3,"1. Lord Jesus Christ, be present now,\nOur hearts in true devotion bow,\nThy Spirit send with grace divine,\nAnd let Thy truth within us shine.\n\n2. Unseal our lips to sing Thy praise,\nOur souls to Thee in worship raise,\nMake strong our faith, increase our light,\nThat we may know Thy name aright.\n\n3. Until we join the hosts that cry,\n“Holy art Thou, O Lord, most high!”\nAnd in the light of that blest place\nFor-e'er behold Thee face to face.\n\n4. Glory to God the Father, Son,\nAnd Holy Spirit, Three in One!\nTo Thee, O blessed Trinity,\nBe praise throughout eternity!\n",,,
4,"1. This is the day the Lord hath made;\nHe calls the hours His own;\nLet heav'n re-joice, let earth be glad\nAnd praise surround the throne.\n\n2. To-day He rose and left the dead,\nAnd Sa-tan's em-pire fell;\nTo-day the saints His triumphs spread\nAnd all His won-ders tell.\n\n3. Ho-san-na to th' a-noint-ed King,\nTo Da-vid's ho-ly Son!\nHelp us, O Lord! de-scend and bring\nSal-va-tion from Thy throne.\n\n4. Blest be the Lord, Who comes to men\nWith messages of grace;\nWho comes in God His Father's name\nTo save our sinful race.\n\n5. Hosanna in the highest strains\nThe Church on earth can raise.\nThe highest heav'ns in which He reigns,\nShall give Him nobler praise.\n",,,
5,"1. Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!\nThat calls me from a world of care,\nAnd bids me at my Father's throne\nMake all my wants and wishes known\nIn seasons of distress and grief,\nMy soul has often found relief,\nAnd oft escaped the tempter's snare,\nBy thy return, sweet hour of prayer!\n\n2. Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!\nThy wings shall my petition bear\nTo Him whose truth and faithfulness\nEngage the waiting soul to bless;\nAnd since He bids me seek His face,\nBelieve His Word, and trust His grace\nI'll cast on Him my every care,\nAnd wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!\n\n3. Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!\nMay I thy consolation share,\nTill, from Mount Pisgah's lofty height,\nI view my home and take my flight.\nThis robe of flesh I'll drop, and rise\nTo seize the everlasting prize;\nAnd shout, while passing through the air,\n“Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer!”\n",,,
6,"1. Christ whose glory fills the skies,\nChrist, the true, the only Light,\nSun of righteousness, arise,\nTriumph o'er the shades of night.\nDayspring from on high, be near;\nDaystar, in my heart appear.\n\n2. Dark and cheerless is the morn\nUnaccompanied by Thee;\nJoyless is the day's return,\nTill Thy mercy's beams I see\nTill they inward light impart,\nGlad my eyes, and warm my heart.\n\n3. Visit, then, this soul of mine;\nPierce the gloom of sin and grief;\nFill me, Radiancy Divine;\nScatter all my unbelief;\nMore and more Thyself display,\nShining to the perfect day.\n",,,
7,"1. How honoured, how dear,\nThat sacred abode,\nWhere Christians draw near\nTheir Father and God!\n'Mid worldly commotion,\nMy wearied soul faints\nFor th' house of devotion,\nThe home of Thy saints.\n\n2. The birds have their home,\nThey fix on their nest;\nWherever they roam,\nThey turn to their rest:\nFrom them fondly learning,\nMy soul would take wing;\nTo Thee so returning,\nMy God and my King.\n\n3. Oh, happy the choirs\nWho praise Thee above!\nWhat joy tunes their lyres!\nTheir worship is love.\nYet safe in Thy keeping\nAnd happy they be\nIn this world of weeping,\nWhose strength is in Thee.\n\n4. Though rugged their way,\nThey drink, as they go,\nOf springs that convey\nNew life as they flow:\nThe God they rely on,\nTheir strength shall renew,\nTill earth brought to Zion,\nHis glory shall view.\n\n5. Thou Hearer of prayer,\nStill grant me a place\nWhere Christians repair\nTo th' courts of Thy grace:\nMore blest, beyond measure,\nOne day so employed,\nThan years of vain pleasure\nBy worldlings enjoyed.\n\n6. The Lord is a Sun,\nThe Lord is a Shield;\nWhat grace has begun,\nWith glory is sealed.\nHe hears the distressed,\nAnd He succours the just:\nAnd they shall be blessed\nWho will make Him their trust.\n",,,
8,"1. Sit down beneath His shadow,\nAnd rest with great delight;\nThe faith that now beholds Him\nIs pledge of future sight.\n\n2. Our Master's love remember,\nExceeding great and free;\nLift up thy heart in gladness,\nFor He remembers thee.\n\n3. Bring every weary burden,\nThy sin, thy fear, thy grief;\nHe calls the heavy laden,\nAnd gives them kind relief.\n\n4. A little while, though parted,\nRemember, wait and love;\nUntil He comes in glory,\nUntil we meet above:\n\n5. Till in the Father's Kingdom\nThe heavenly feast is spread;\nAnd we behold His beauty,\nWhose blood for us was shed!\n",,,
9,"1. Praise, my soul, the King of heaven;\nTo His feet thy tribute bring;\nRansomed, healed, restored, forgiven;\nWho like me His praise should sing?\nPraise Him ! Praise Him !\nPraise Him ! Praise Him !\nPraise the everlasting King.\n\n2. Praise Him for His grace and favour\nTo our fathers in distress;\nPraise Him, still the same for ever,\nSlow to chide and swift to bless:\nPraise Him ! Praise Him !\nPraise Him ! Praise Him !\nGlorious in His faithfulness.\n\n3. Father-like He tends and spares us\nWell our feeble frame He knows\nIn His hand He gently bears us,\nRescues us from all our foes:\nPraise Him ! Praise Him !\nPraise Him ! Praise Him !\nWidely as His mercy flows.\n\n4. Angels, help us to adore Him,\nYe behold Him face to face!\nSun and moon, bow down before Him!\nDwellers all in time and space,\nPraise Him ! Praise Him !\nPraise Him ! Praise Him !\nPraise with us the God of grace!\n",,,
10,"1. Praise to the Holiest in the height,\nAnd in the depth be praise:\nIn all His words most wonderful,\nMost sure in all His ways.\n\n2. O loving wisdom of our God !\nWhen all was sin and shame,\nA second Adam to the fight\nAnd to the rescue came.\n\n3. O wisest love ! that flesh and blood,\nWhich did in Adam fail,\nShould strive afresh against the foe,\nShould strive and should prevail.\n\n4. And that a higher gift than grace\nShould flesh and blood refine,\nGod's presence, and His very self,\nAnd essence all-divine.\n\n5. O gracious love! that He who smote\nIn Man, for man, the foe,\nThe double agony in Man,\nFor man should undergo.\n\n6. And in the garden secretly,\nAnd on the Cross on high,\nShould teach His brethren, and inspire\nTo suffer and to die.\n\n7. Praise to the Holiest in the height,\nAnd in the depth be praise:\nIn all His words most wonderful,\nMost sure in all His ways.\n",,,
11,"1. Praise to the Lord, the Almighty,\nthe King of creation!\nO my soul, praise Him, for He is thy\nHealth and Salvation!\nJoin the full throng;\nWake, harp and psalter and song;\nSound forth in glad adoration!\n\n2. Praise to the Lord, who o'er all things so\nWondrously reigneth,\nWho, as on wings of an eagle,\nUplifteth, sustaineth.\nHast thou not seen\nHow thy desires all have been\nGranted in what He ordaineth?\n\n3. Praise to the Lord, who hath fearfully,\nWondrously, made thee;\nHealth hath vouchsafed and, when\nHeedlessly falling, hath stayed thee.\nWhat need or grief\nEver hath failed of relief?\nWings of His mercy did shade thee.\n\n4. Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper\nThy work and defend thee;\nWho from the heavens the streams of\nHis mercy doth send thee.\nPonder anew\nWhat the Almighty can do,\nWho with His love doth befriend thee.\n\n5. Praise to the Lord! Oh, let all that is in\nMe adore Him!\nAll that hath life and breath, come\nNow with praises before Him!\nLet the Amen\nSound from His people again;\nGladly for aye we adore Him\n",,,
12,"1. The Lord, my God, be praised,\nMy Light, my Life from heaven;\nMy Maker, who to me\nHath soul and body given;\nMy Father, who doth shield\nAnd keep me day by day.\nDoth make each moment yield\nNew blessings on my way.\n\n2. The Lord, my God, be praised,\nMy Trust, my Life from heaven,\nThe Father's own dear Son,\nWhose life for me was given;\nWho for my sin atoned\nWith His most precious blood,\nWho giveth me by faith\nThe highest heav'nly good.\n\n3. The Lord, my God, be praised,\nMy Hope, my Life from Heaven,\nThe Spirit, whom the Son\nIn love to me hath given\n‘Tis He revives my heart,\n‘Tis He that gives me pow'r,\nHelp, comfort, and support\nIn sorrow's gloomy hour.\n\n4. The Lord, my God, be praised,\nMy God, who ever liveth,\nTo whom the heavenly host\nAll praise and honor giveth,\nThe Lord, my God, be praised,\nIn whose great name I boast,\nGod Father, God the Son,\nAnd God the Holy Ghost.\n\n5. To Him with joyful song\nOur praises we are bringing\nAnd with the angel throng\nThrice “Holy” we are singing.\nWith one united voice\nThe Church doth Him adore.\nThe Lord, my God, be praised\nNow and forevermore.\n",,,
13,"1. O Lord of heav'n and earth and sea\nTo Thee all praise and glory be.\nHow shall we show our love to Thee,\nWho givest all?\n\n2. The golden sunshine, vernal air,\nSweet flow'rs and fruit, Thy love declare.\nWhen harvest ripen, Thou art there,\nWho givest all.\n\n3. For peaceful homes and healthful days,\nFor all the blessings earth displays,\nWe owe Thee thankfulness and praise,\nWho givest all.\n\n4. Thou didst not spare Thine only Son,\nBut gav'st Him for a world undone,\nAnd freely with that Blessed One\nThou givest all.\n\n5. Thou giv'st the spirit's holy dower,\nSpirit of Life and Love and Power,\nAnd dost His sev'nfold graces show'r\nUpon us all.\n\n6. For souls redeemed, for sins forgiv'n,\nFor means of grace and hopes of heav'n,\nWhat can to Thee, O Lord, be giv'n,\nWho givest all?\n\n7. We lose what on ourselves we spend;\nWe have as treasure without end,\nWhatever, Lord, to Thee we lend,\nWho givest all.\n\n8. To Thee, from whom we all derive\nOur life, our gifts, our power to give.\nOh, may we ever with Thee live,\nWho givest all!\n",,,

15,"1. Fairest Lord Jesus,\nRuler of all nature,\nO Thou of God and man the Son;\nThee will I cherish,\nThee will I honour,\nThou my soul's glory, joy and crown.\n\n2. Fair are the meadows,\nFairer still the woodlands,\nRobed in the blooming garb of spring;\nJesus is fairer,\nJesus is purer,\nWho makes the woeful heart to sing.\n\n3. Fair is the sunshine,\nFairer still the moonlight,\nAnd fair the twinkling starry host;\nJesus shines brighter,\nJesus shines purer,\nThan Thou, my Saviour, art to me.\n",,,
16,"1. Oh, that I had a thousand voices\nTo praise my God with thousand tongues !\nMy heart, which in the Lord re - joices,\nWould then proclaim in grateful songs\nTo all, wherever I might be,\nWhat great things God hath done for me.\n\n2. O all ye pow'rs that He implanted,\nArise, and silence keep no more;\nPut forth the strength that He hath granted,\nYour noblest work is to adore.\nO soul and body, be ye meet,\nWith heart - felt praise your Lord to greet !\n\n3. Ye forest leaves so green and tender,\nThat dance for joy in summer air;\nYe meadow grasses, bright and slender;\nYe flow'rs, so wondrous sweet and fair;\nYe live to show His praise alone,\nWith me now make His glory known.\n\n4. All creatures that have breath and motion,\nThat throng the earth, the sea, and sky,\nNow join me in my heart's devotion,\nHelp me to raise His praises high.\nMy utmost pow'rs can ne'er aright\nDeclare the wonders of His might.\n\n5. Lord, I will tell while I am living,\nThy goodness forth with every breath;\nAnd greet each morning with thanksgiving\nUntil my heart is still in death;\nYea, when at last my lips grow cold,\nThy praise shall in my sighs be told.\n\n6. O Father, deign Thou, I beseech Thee,\nTo listen to my earthly lays;\nA nobler strain in heav'n shall reach Thee,\nWhen I with angels hymn Thy praise\nAnd learn amid their choirs to sing\nLoud hallelujahs to my King.\n",,,

40,"1. To God be the glory, great things He hath done,\nSo loved He the world that He gave us His Son,\nWho yielded His life an atonement for sin,\nAnd opened the Life - gate that all may go in. \n\nCh : Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,\nLet the earth hear His voice,\nPraise the Lord, praise the Lord,\nLet the people rejoice,\nO come to the Father, thro' Jesus the Son,\nAnd give Him the glory, great things\nHe hath done. \n\n2. O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,\nTo every believer the promise of God;\nThe vilest offender who truly believes,\nThat moment from Jesus a pardon receives. \n\nCh : Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,\nLet the earth hear His voice,\nPraise the Lord, praise the Lord,\nLet the people rejoice,\nO come to the Father, thro' Jesus the Son,\nAnd give Him the glory, great things\nHe hath done. \n\n3. Great things He hath taught us, great things\nHe hath done.\nAnd great our rejoicing thro' Jesus the Son;\nBut purer, and higher, and greater will be\nOur wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see. \n\nCh : Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,\nLet the earth hear His voice,\nPraise the Lord, praise the Lord,\nLet the people rejoice,\nO come to the Father, thro' Jesus the Son,\nAnd give Him the glory, great things\nHe hath done.",,,

43,"1. O Lord, my God! When I in awesome wonder\nConsider all the works Thy hands have made,\nI see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,\nThy power throughout the universe displayed. Ch. Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, To Thee.\nHow great Thou art, how great Thou art!\nThen sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee.\nHow great Thou art, how great Thou art!  \n\n2. When through the woods and forest glades I wander\nAnd hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;\nWhen I look down from lofty mountain grandeur\nAnd hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze. Ch. Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, To Thee.\nHow great Thou art, how great Thou art!\nThen sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee.\nHow great Thou art, how great Thou art! \n\n3. And when I think that God, His Son not sparing,\nSent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;\nThat on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,\nHe bled and died to take away my sin. \n\n4. When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation\nAnd take me home, what joys shall fill my heart!\nThen I shall bow in humble adoration\nAnd there proclaim, My God, how great Thou art!",,,

O Saviour, with pro-tect-ing care\nA-bide in this Thy house of prayer,\nWhere we Thy part-ing prom-ise claim,\nAs-sem-bled in Thy sa-cred name.\n\n3. But, chiefest, in our cleansed breast,\nE-ter-nal, bid Thy Spirit rest\nAnd make our secret soul to be\nA temple pure and worthy Thee.\n\n4. So in the last and dread-ful day,\nWhen earth and heav'n shall melt away,\nThy flock, redeemed from sin-ful stain,\nShall swell the sound of praise again.\n",,,
59,"1. When sinners see their lost con-di-tion\nAnd feel the pressing load of sin,\nAnd Jesus cometh on His mission\nTo heal the sin-sick heart within,\nAll grief must flee before His grace,\nAnd joy divine will take its place.\n\n2. When Jesus enters meek and lowly,\nTo fill the home with sweetest peace;\nWhen hearts have felt His blessing holy\nAnd found from sin complete release,\nThen light and calm within shall reign\nAnd hearts divided love again.\n\n3. When Jesus enters land and nation\nAnd moves the people with His love;\nWhen, yielding to His kind persuasion,\nOur hearts His truth and blessing prove,\nThen shall our life on earth be blest,\nThe peace of God on us shall rest.\n\n4. When Jesus comes, O blessed story!\nHe works a change in heart and life;\nGod's Kingdom comes with pow'r and glory\nTo young and old, to man and wife;\nThro' Sacrament and living Word,\nFaith, love, and hope are now conferred.\n\n5. Then stilled are cries and lamentation,\nThen loosed is Satan's every band;\nIn death is hope and consolation,\nThe soul is safe in Jesus' hand.\nWhen we shall walk through death's dark vale,\nHis rod and staff shall never fail.\n\n6. Oh, may He soon to every nation\nFind entrance where He is unknown,\nWith life and light and full salvation,\nThat heathendom may be o'erthrown\nAnd healing to the hearts may come\nIn heathen land and Christian home!\n",,,

The Church from her dear Master\nReceived the gift divine,\nAnd still that light she lifteth\nO'er all the earth to shine.\nIt is the golden casket\nWhere gems of truth are stored;\nIt is the heav'n-drawn picture\nOf Christ, the living Word.\n\n3. It floateth like a banner\nBefore God's host unfurled\nIt shineth like a beacon\nAbove the darkening world;\nIt is the chart and compass\nThat o'er life's surging sea,\nMid mists and rocks and quicksands,\nStill guides, O Christ, to Thee.\n\n4. Oh, make Thy Church, dear Saviour,\nA lamp of burnished gold\nTo bear before the nations\nThy true light as of old!\nOh, teach Thy wand'ring pilgrims\nBy this their path to trace\nTill, clouds and darkness ended,\nThey see Thee face to face!\n",,,

231,"1. Salvation unto us has come\nBy God's free grace and favour;\nGood works cannot avert our doom,\nThey help and save us never.\nFaith looks to Jesus Christ alone,\nWho did for all the world atone;\nHe is our one Redeemer.\n\n2. What God did in His Law demand\nAnd none to Him could render.\nCaused wrath and woe on ev'ry hand\nFor man, the vile offender,\nOur flesh has not those pure desires\nThe spirit of the Law requires,\nAnd lost is our condition.\n\n3. It was a false, misleading dream\nThat God His Law had given\nThat sinners could themselves redeem\nAnd by their works gain heaven,\nThe Law is but a mirror bright,\nTo bring the inbred sin to light\nThat lurks within our nature.\n\n4. From sin our flesh could not abstain,\nSin held its sway unceasing;\nThe task was use-less and in vain,\nOur guilt was e'er increasing.\nNone can remove sin's poisoned dart\nOr purify our guileful heart-----\nSo deep is our corruption.\n",,,

Thou hast, O Lord, returned,\nTo God's right hand ascending;\nYet Thou art in the world,\nThy kingdom here extending,\nThro' preaching of Thy Word\nIn ev'ry land and clime,\nThy people's faith is kept\nUntil the end of time.\n\n3. O blessed ministry,\nOf reconciliation,\nThat shows the way to God\nAnd brings to us salvation!\nBy Thine evangel pure,\nLord, Thou preserv'st Thy fold,\nDost call, enlighten, keep,\nDost comfort and uphold.\n\n4. Preserve this ministry,\nWhile harvest - days are keeping;\nAnd since the fields are white\nAnd hands are few for reaping,\nSend workers forth, O Lord,\nThe sheaves to gather in,\nThat not a soul be lost\nWhich Thou art come to win.\n\n5. The servants Thou hast called\nAnd to Thy Church art giving,\nPreserve in doctrine pure,\nAnd holiness of living.\nThy Spirit fill their hearts,\nEndue their tongue with power;\nWhat they should boldly speak,\nOh, give them in that hour.\n",,,
